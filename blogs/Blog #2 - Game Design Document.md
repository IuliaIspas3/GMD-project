2. Product Design 


2.1. Player Experience and Game POV 

A humanoid character sneaking through dark and mysterious Edinburgh city. The game should make the player feel excited, thrilled, and challenged at all times. The eagerness of the player should be to collect the necessary number of coins while avoiding obstacles and enemies. 

2.2. Visual and Audio style 

The ambience of the game is dark, foggy, and magical. To offer a Scottish vibe to the city and to introduce the player better into the game world, the brick texture should be added to the buildings and also a Celtic, relaxing background music. 

2.3. Game World ficition 

The fiction of the game is inspired by a series called Outlander, where the action is happening in Scotland mainly and which had one of the main characters travelling through time in another century. Based on these details, the game should be set in mysterious and dark Edinburgh, and the main character should be a stranger, called Greer, born in the 18th century, lost in the future. She should try collecting all the coins by avoiding obstacles and enemies, since they affect her lifespan, in order to return to her own time. 

2.4. Platform(s), Technology and Scope 

The game is a 3D perspective platformer, developed using Unity as the engine and the primary editor. C# was used for scripting with Rider as the code editor for attaching and managing scripts on game objects. The game is playable on PC, using both keyboard and controller commands and on the VIA Arcade machine.  

The project was made by a 2-person team, dividing the work equally. The time spent on it was around 4 months with approximately 4 hours per week. The first playable version was in the 2nd month. 

 

3. Detailed & Game Systems Design 


3.1. Core loops 

The player navigates the environment, collects coins, avoids enemies, manages health, since they affect the character’s immunity, repeating this loop across the game until the player either dies or wins. This continuous challenge-reward cycle keeps the player engaged and encourages exploration. 

3.2. Objectives and Progression 

The player runs on the streets, climbs and jumps on buildings or on lamps through the city, but also crouches. It sneaks around the corners of the building in order to collect the coins, and avoid enemies. The player needs to collect the necessary number of coins in order to finish the level (game). We have only one level so far. 

3.3. Game systems 

This game relies on several core systems: movement and physics systems, enemy AI using NavMesh, and animations. For the Input System, we used both new and old systems, the new one for methods like OnJump() and the old one where we are checking which command was triggered.  

3.4. Interactivity 

The player’s interactivity is mainly focused on running, jumping on buildings and obstacles, crouching under obstacles, and side-walking between tight buildings.
