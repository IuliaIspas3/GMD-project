The development of the “Roll-a-ball” project followed the structured steps provided in the tutorial, ensuring a solid foundation for the core game mechanics. The game environment was created using basic Unity objects, with a plane for the ground and cubes for obstacles and walls. The player character, a sphere with a Rigidbody component, moves using keyboard input, with a script applying force to control movement smoothly.
Collectible objects were added to the scene, each with a trigger collider and a script enabling collection upon player contact. Once collected, they disappear, contributing to the player’s score displayed on the UI, which updates dynamically to reflect progress.
To increase difficulty, an AI-controlled enemy was implemented using Unity’s NavMesh system. The enemy, represented by a resized cube, dynamically navigates the scene, following the player while avoiding obstacles. The NavMesh Agent component enables smooth movement along walkable areas, requiring players to maneuver strategically.
Win and lose conditions define the game’s completion state. The player wins after collecting all objects, triggering a victory message on the UI. If the enemy reaches the player a certain number of times, the game ends in defeat with a game-over message. These mechanics were implemented using Unity’s event system and UI components to provide clear objectives and challenges.
Additional Features
To enhance visuals, I applied textures to various objects. The ground was given a grass-like texture, one obstacle was designed to resemble a building with windows, and the remaining obstacles and walls were textured with a brick pattern. These textures, sourced from the internet, were imported into Unity and assigned to the Base Map of materials, with Tiling adjustments for proper scaling.
A day-night cycle was implemented to add dynamism, transitioning every 30 seconds. This was achieved with a dedicated GameObject controlling lighting transitions via a custom C# script that gradually adjusts lighting parameters. A Day-Night Skyboxes package from the Unity Asset Store was used to create realistic sky transitions, making the game environment more engaging.
These enhancements make the Roll-a-Ball game more immersive and visually appealing. Textures improve aesthetics, while the day-night cycle adds more dynamism. The AI-controlled enemy introduces a strategic challenge, and clear win/lose conditions provide structured gameplay. This project was a great opportunity to learn Unity fundamentals while exploring materials, textures, and environmental scripting.
